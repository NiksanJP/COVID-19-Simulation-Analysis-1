# COVID-19-Simulation-Analysis-1

University Project to simulate and analyse COVID-19.
This experiment only includes the original COVID-19.

## Problem
Covid-19 or SARS-COV-2 was first detected in Wuhan China, has spread around the world. This virus in its first 
year has infected over 135 million people and killed almost 3 million people around the globe. It has costs 
people their livelihood and trillions of dollars in economic damage, it has brought humans to a standstill. After 
a year and more there has been plenty of data collected regarding covid-19 and its cases around the globe. For 
this project, it has been concluded to perform simulation and test to their spread for different populations and 
different countries. We will also discuss their Reproduction Number of how we can expect the infection to 
increase.
There remains mystery on how it spread through the population, but we want to find if measures taken by
countries are lower than the Basic Reproduction Number (BRN) of the pathogen. This determines if the trend 
of infections is on the rise or declining. With the knowledge gained from this data we can assess the strategy 
and will also be able to predict the number of infections in the future. This will further help governments 
around the world to decide on policy to curb infection number and effective decision making until the vaccine 
have arrived. We will also compare the Reproduction number for USA and check effectiveness of the policies. 
We will compare the reproduction number for USA and the BRN for USA and the covid-19 itself.
By this analysis, the governments around the globe would have data and analysis required for their policy 
modeling to minimize damage to the economy and minimizing the infection numbers.


## Aproach
Our approach is very simple, we want to experiment what type of population/countries are more vulnerable to 
covid-19. Firstly, we will be experimenting with a simulation for a normal population of 500 people with a 
default size of land mass. Then we will compare what happens if the virus is introduced to a very dense 
population with same population and then socially distant population with same population size.
We will confirm if our hypothesis is true for countries and regions around the world. For each population we 
will check their density and covid-19 infections, this will show the correlation between density and spread of 
the virus. We will further check the correlation with policies and covid-19 cases if we can find a correlation 
between face-mask policies and reduction of covid-19.
We will further study how the covid-19 should be spreading using their Basic Reproduction Number (BRN)
using this we can check how well the countries has been controlling the spread. We will take a country and 
check their basic reproduction number for that country and compare it will the virusâ€™s BRN itself to check the 
effectiveness of Covid-19
